Task 10: Firewall Configuration & Testing
----------------------------------------

Objective:
The objective of this task is to understand firewall concepts and learn how firewalls are configured, tested, and monitored to protect systems and networks. Firewalls act as a security control that filters network traffic based on predefined rules.

Firewalls are a critical component of network security and are used to prevent unauthorized access while allowing legitimate communication.

What is a Firewall:
A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.

Types of Firewalls:

1. Stateful Firewall
A stateful firewall tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of traffic. It is more secure and commonly used.

2. Stateless Firewall
A stateless firewall filters traffic based only on predefined rules without tracking connection state. It is faster but less secure.

Inbound and Outbound Rules:
- Inbound rules control traffic coming into the system.
- Outbound rules control traffic leaving the system.

Firewall Rules:
Firewall rules define which traffic is allowed or denied based on:
- IP address
- Port number
- Protocol
- Direction (inbound or outbound)

Firewall Logs:
Firewall logs record allowed and blocked traffic. Logs are useful for monitoring suspicious activity and troubleshooting connectivity issues.

Limitations of Firewalls:
Firewalls cannot stop all attacks. They do not protect against:
- Application-level vulnerabilities
- Insider threats
- Malware delivered through allowed traffic

Conclusion:
Firewalls play a crucial role in network defense by controlling traffic flow and reducing the attack surface. Proper configuration, testing, and monitoring are essential for effective firewall protection.
