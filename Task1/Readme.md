# Cyber Security Internship – Task 1  
## Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

---

## 📌 About This Task

This repository contains my work for **Task 1** of the Cyber Security Internship.  
The objective of this task was to understand fundamental cybersecurity concepts such as the CIA triad, types of cyber attackers, attack surfaces, and the importance of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities through self-research and analysis.

## 🔍 What I Did

To complete this task, I performed the following steps:

- Researched the meaning of **Cyber Security** and its importance in modern digital systems  
- Studied the **CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)** with real-world examples  
- Identified and analyzed different **types of cyber attackers**  
- Explored common **attack surfaces** across applications and infrastructure  
- Reviewed the **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities and understood why they are critical  
- Mapped **daily-used applications** to their possible attack surfaces  
- Analyzed how **data flows** in an application and where attacks can occur  
- Summarized all findings in my own words for clarity and understanding

## 🔐 CIA Triad – My Understanding

### Confidentiality  
I learned that confidentiality ensures sensitive data is accessed only by authorized users.  
Examples include encrypted banking transactions and private messaging applications.

### Integrity  
Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unchanged unless modified by authorized users.  
This is critical in financial transactions and system logs.

### Availability  
Availability ensures that systems and services remain accessible whenever needed.  
Attacks like DDoS and ransomware mainly target availability.

## 👤 Types of Cyber Attackers I Studied

- **Script Kiddies:** Use ready-made tools with minimal technical knowledge  
- **Insider Threats:** Employees or trusted individuals misusing access  
- **Hacktivists:** Attack for political or ideological reasons  
- **Nation-State Actors:** Highly skilled attackers targeting governments and infrastructure  

---

## 🎯 Attack Surface – My Analysis

I understood that an **attack surface** includes all possible entry points that an attacker can exploit.

### Common Attack Surfaces:
- Web applications  
- Mobile applications  
- APIs  
- Networks  
- Cloud infrastructure  
- End-user devices  

A larger attack surface increases the chances of exploitation if not properly secured.

## 🔟 OWASP Top 10 – What I Learned

I reviewed the OWASP Top 10 to understand the most common and dangerous web application vulnerabilities.

### Key Takeaways:
- OWASP Top 10 reflects real-world attack patterns  
- It helps organizations prioritize security risks  
- It is widely used as a security baseline in the industry  

Some common risks include injection attacks, broken authentication, and security misconfigurations.

## 📱 Mapping Daily Applications to Attack Surfaces

| Application | Possible Attack Surface |
|------------|------------------------|
| Email | Phishing, malicious attachments |
| WhatsApp | Account takeover, device compromise |
| Banking Apps | Insecure APIs, credential theft |
| Social Media | Credential stuffing, session hijacking |

## 🔄 Application Data Flow Analysis

I studied a typical application data flow:
