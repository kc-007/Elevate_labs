1. Introduction to Cyber Security

Cyber Security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, applications, and data from digital attacks. These attacks aim to gain unauthorized access, disrupt services, steal sensitive data, or manipulate information. As organizations increasingly rely on digital infrastructure, cybersecurity plays a critical role in ensuring trust, safety, and business continuity.

2. CIA Triad (Core Principles of Cyber Security)

The CIA Triad represents the three fundamental objectives of cybersecurity:

a) Confidentiality

Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users.

Examples:

Banking applications protecting account details

Encrypted WhatsApp messages preventing third-party access

Threats: Data breaches, phishing, unauthorized access

b) Integrity

Ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered unless authorized.

Examples:

Transaction amounts not being modified during online payments

Logs remaining tamper-proof for audits

Threats: SQL injection, data manipulation, malware

c) Availability

Ensures that systems and data are accessible when required.

Examples:

Online banking services being available 24/7

Email services functioning without downtime

Threats: DDoS attacks, server failures, ransomware

3. Types of Cyber Attackers
a) Script Kiddies

Low-skill attackers

Use ready-made tools and exploits

Target poorly secured systems

b) Insider Threats

Employees or trusted individuals

Can be intentional or accidental

Very dangerous due to internal access

c) Hacktivists

Ideologically motivated attackers

Aim to spread political or social messages

Often use defacement or data leaks

d) Nation-State Actors

Highly skilled and well-funded

Conduct espionage, cyber warfare

Target governments, defense, critical infrastructure

4. Attack Surface

An attack surface is the sum of all points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data from a system.

Common Attack Surfaces:

Web applications

Mobile applications

APIs

Networks (Wi-Fi, routers, firewalls)

Cloud infrastructure

User endpoints (laptops, mobiles)

Larger attack surface = Higher risk

5. OWASP Top 10 (Why It Matters)

OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application security risks.

It is important because:

Covers real-world, frequently exploited vulnerabilities

Used as an industry security baseline

Helps developers and security teams prioritize fixes

Examples of OWASP Risks:

Injection attacks

Broken authentication

Sensitive data exposure

Security misconfigurations

6. Mapping Daily Applications to Attack Surfaces
Application	Possible Attack Surface
Email	Phishing, malware attachments
WhatsApp	Account takeover, device compromise
Banking App	Insecure APIs, credential theft
Social Media	Credential stuffing, session hijacking
7. Data Flow in an Application

Typical Data Flow:

User → Application → Server → Database → Server → Application → User

Points Where Attacks Can Occur:

User input (Injection attacks)

Application logic (Broken authentication)

Network communication (Man-in-the-Middle)

Server configuration (Misconfigurations)

Database access (Unauthorized data access)

8. Vulnerability vs Threat vs Risk

Vulnerability: A weakness in a system

Threat: A potential cause of harm

Risk: The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability

Example:
Unpatched server (vulnerability) + hacker (threat) = data breach risk

9. Conclusion

This task provides a strong foundation in cybersecurity by introducing essential concepts such as the CIA triad, attacker profiles, attack surfaces, and OWASP Top 10 risks. Understanding how data flows through applications and identifying potential attack points helps in thinking like both a defender and an attacker. These fundamentals are crucial for any cybersecurity professional and form the base for advanced security practices.
