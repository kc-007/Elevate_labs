Task 4: Password Security & Authentication Analysis
--------------------------------------------------

Objective:
The objective of this task is to understand how passwords are stored, attacked, and protected in real-world systems. The task focuses on password hashing, common password attacks, and modern authentication mechanisms such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Passwords are one of the most common authentication methods. Weak password practices often lead to data breaches, making password security a critical part of cybersecurity.

Password Storage:

Passwords should never be stored in plain text. Instead, they are stored using hashing algorithms.

Hashing vs Encryption:
Hashing is a one-way process that converts a password into a fixed-length value. It cannot be reversed.
Encryption is a two-way process where data can be decrypted using a key.

Because hashing is irreversible, it is preferred for storing passwords.

Common Hash Types:

1. MD5
MD5 is a fast hashing algorithm but is considered insecure due to collisions and fast cracking speeds.

2. SHA-1
SHA-1 is stronger than MD5 but is also deprecated due to known weaknesses.

3. bcrypt
bcrypt is a secure hashing algorithm designed specifically for password storage. It is slow and includes salting, making it resistant to brute-force attacks.

Password Attacks:

Brute Force Attack:
In a brute force attack, attackers try all possible password combinations until the correct one is found.

Dictionary Attack:
In a dictionary attack, attackers use a predefined list of common passwords to crack hashes faster.

Weak Passwords:
Weak passwords fail because they are short, predictable, reused, or based on common words.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring more than one authentication factor, such as a password and a one-time code.

Importance of Strong Authentication:
Strong authentication reduces the risk of account compromise, even if passwords are leaked.

Conclusion:
Understanding how passwords are attacked and protected helps in designing secure authentication systems. Strong hashing algorithms, strong passwords, and MFA together form an effective defense against password-based attacks.
