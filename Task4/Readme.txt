## 📌 Overview

This document explains how I completed **Task 4** of the Cyber Security Internship by studying password storage mechanisms, analyzing password attacks, and understanding secure authentication practices.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources Used

- Hashcat  
- John the Ripper  
- Online hash identifiers  
- Cybersecurity articles and documentation  

Only free tools and resources were used.

---

## 🔧 Steps I Followed

### 1️⃣ Understanding Password Storage
- Learned the difference between hashing and encryption
- Understood why hashing is used for password storage
- Studied common hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, and bcrypt

---

### 2️⃣ Identifying Hash Types
- Used online hash identification tools to recognize hash formats
- Compared weak and strong hashing algorithms based on speed and security

---

### 3️⃣ Generating Password Hashes
- Created sample password hashes using different algorithms
- Observed how the same password produces different hashes when salted

---

### 4️⃣ Cracking Weak Hashes
- Used wordlists to attempt cracking weak hashes
- Understood how dictionary attacks work in practice
- Observed that weak passwords are cracked quickly

---

### 5️⃣ Brute Force vs Dictionary Attacks
- Studied how brute force attacks try all combinations
- Compared them with dictionary attacks that use common password lists
- Noted that dictionary attacks are faster against weak passwords

---

### 6️⃣ Analyzing Why Weak Passwords Fail
- Short length
- Common patterns
- Reuse across multiple platforms
- Lack of complexity

---

### 7️⃣ Studying MFA
- Learned how Multi-Factor Authentication works
- Understood how MFA protects accounts even if passwords are compromised

---

## 🔐 Recommendations for Strong Authentication

- Use long and unique passwords
- Avoid common words and patterns
- Store passwords using bcrypt or similar algorithms
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication
- Avoid password reuse

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

- How passwords are stored securely
- How attackers crack weak passwords
- Why strong hashing algorithms matter
- Importance of MFA in modern security
