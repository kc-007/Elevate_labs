## 📌 Overview

This document explains how I completed **Task 9** of the Cyber Security Internship by performing network scanning and analyzing exposed services using network scanning tools.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources Used

- Nmap  
- Local network environment  
- Cybersecurity documentation  

Only authorized and local network targets were scanned.

---

## 🔧 Steps I Followed

### 1️⃣ Scanning the Local Network
- Identified the local network range
- Performed a basic scan to detect live hosts
- Ensured scanning was limited to authorized systems

---

### 2️⃣ Identifying Open Ports
- Used Nmap to scan for open TCP ports
- Observed which ports were open and accessible
- Noted commonly exposed ports such as HTTP and SSH

---

### 3️⃣ Detecting Running Services
- Identified services running on open ports
- Observed service names and versions
- Understood how service information can be useful to attackers

---

### 4️⃣ Operating System Detection
- Used OS detection features to identify the target system’s OS
- Understood how OS fingerprinting works

---

### 5️⃣ Analyzing Potential Vulnerabilities
- Reviewed exposed services for potential security risks
- Identified unnecessary services increasing attack surface
- Understood the importance of patching and service hardening

---

### 6️⃣ Saving Scan Results
- Saved Nmap scan outputs for documentation
- Used scan results for further analysis and reporting

---

### 7️⃣ Interpreting Risks
- Analyzed which open ports posed higher risk
- Considered the impact of exposed services
- Related findings to real-world attack scenarios

---

### 8️⃣ Documenting Findings
Documented:
- Open ports
- Running services
- OS details
- Security observations

---

## 📋 Observations

- Open ports increase exposure to attacks
- Service enumeration reveals valuable system information
- Unnecessary services should be disabled
- Regular scanning improves network security posture

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Basics of network reconnaissance
- How port scanning works
- Importance of service enumeration
- Role of network scanning in vulnerability management
