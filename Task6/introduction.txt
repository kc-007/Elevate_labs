Task 6: Introduction to Cryptography
-----------------------------------

Objective:
The objective of this task is to understand the fundamentals of cryptography, including encryption, hashing, key generation, and digital signatures. Cryptography is a core security mechanism used to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

Cryptography is widely used in real-world technologies such as HTTPS, VPNs, secure file storage, and authentication systems.

Encryption:
Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext) to protect it from unauthorized access.

There are two main types of encryption:

1. Symmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It is fast and efficient, making it suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.
Example: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

2. Asymmetric Encryption
Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. Data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other.
Example: RSA

Hashing:
Hashing is a one-way cryptographic function that converts data into a fixed-length hash value. Hashing is used to verify data integrity and is not reversible.

Digital Signatures:
Digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography to verify the authenticity and integrity of data. They ensure that the data has not been altered and confirm the identity of the sender.

Comparison of Encryption Algorithms:
- Symmetric encryption is faster but requires secure key sharing.
- Asymmetric encryption is more secure for key exchange but slower.

Real-World Usage of Cryptography:
- HTTPS secures web communication
- VPNs protect network traffic
- Hashing ensures file integrity
- Digital signatures verify software and documents

Conclusion:
Cryptography is essential for securing modern digital systems. Understanding encryption, hashing, and key management helps in protecting sensitive information and ensuring secure communication.
