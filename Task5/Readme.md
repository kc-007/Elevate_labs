## 📌 Overview

This document explains how I completed **Task 5** of the Cyber Security Internship by studying malware types and analyzing malware behavior using online analysis tools.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources Used

- VirusTotal  
- Any.Run (free tier – for learning purposes)  
- Cybersecurity blogs and documentation  

Only free and safe resources were used. No live malware was executed locally.

---

## 🔧 Steps I Followed

### 1️⃣ Learning Malware Types
I first studied different malware categories such as:
- Virus
- Worm
- Trojan
- Ransomware

This helped me understand how each malware type behaves and spreads.

---

### 2️⃣ Using VirusTotal
- Collected known malware file hashes from public sources
- Uploaded the hashes to VirusTotal
- Reviewed detection results from multiple antivirus engines

---

### 3️⃣ Analyzing Detection Reports
- Observed detection names from different vendors
- Noted detection ratios (detected vs not detected)
- Understood how signatures vary across security vendors

---

### 4️⃣ Observing Behavior Indicators
- Reviewed behavioral information provided by VirusTotal
- Identified suspicious activities such as network connections and file changes

---

### 5️⃣ Understanding Malware Lifecycle
- Analyzed how malware is delivered and executed
- Understood persistence mechanisms and command-and-control behavior

---

### 6️⃣ Learning Malware Spread Techniques
- Studied common infection vectors like phishing and malicious downloads
- Understood the role of unpatched systems in malware spread

---

### 7️⃣ Identifying Prevention Methods
Documented key prevention practices such as:
- Regular system updates
- Antivirus and endpoint protection
- User awareness
- Restricted permissions

---

## 📋 Observations

- Malware detection varies across antivirus engines
- Ransomware shows aggressive behavior patterns
- Trojans rely heavily on user interaction
- Worms spread rapidly in vulnerable networks

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Different malware types and their behavior
- How malware is detected using online tools
- How attackers spread malware
- Importance of layered security defenses
