## 📌 Overview

This document explains **how I completed Task 2** of the Cyber Security Internship by practically exploring operating system security concepts in Linux and Windows environments.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Ubuntu Linux (Virtual Machine)
- Windows Security Settings
- Terminal (Linux)
- Windows Defender Firewall

Only free and built-in tools were used.

---

## 🔧 Steps I Followed

### 1️⃣ OS Setup
- Used an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine
- Reviewed Windows security features in the host system

---

### 2️⃣ User Accounts & Privileges
- Identified differences between standard users and administrator/root users
- Understood why daily tasks should be done using non-root accounts

---

### 3️⃣ File Permissions in Linux
- Used `ls -l` to view file permissions
- Learned permission values for owner, group, and others
- Studied how `chmod` and `chown` modify permissions and ownership

---

### 4️⃣ Administrator vs Normal User
- Observed restrictions placed on standard users
- Understood security risks of using root privileges unnecessarily

---

### 5️⃣ Firewall Configuration
- Learned the role of UFW in Linux
- Studied Windows Defender Firewall rules
- Understood how firewalls reduce network-based attacks

---

### 6️⃣ Processes and Services
- Identified running processes and background services
- Understood which services are essential and which can be disabled
- Learned how unnecessary services increase the attack surface

---

### 7️⃣ OS Hardening Practices
Documented best practices such as:
- Enabling firewalls
- Applying least privilege
- Removing unused services
- Keeping systems updated
- Limiting administrative access

---

## 📋 OS Security Checklist (Outcome)

- [x] Standard user usage for daily tasks  
- [x] Controlled file permissions  
- [x] Firewall enabled  
- [x] Unnecessary services reviewed  
- [x] Least privilege applied  

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Importance of OS-level security
- How permissions protect system resources
- Why OS hardening is critical for defense
- How attackers exploit misconfigured systems
